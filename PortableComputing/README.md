# Mobile Connections

**Infrared** has to be within line of sight and is a very low frequency connection

# Android

The Android desktop only shows the applications we choose

Notifications are seen by swiping down

The Google Play store is where Android users install applications

We can change permissions for apps if needed

Android phones are associated with a Google account, we can add accounts if desired

# Maintaining Mobile Devices

### Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

The big challenge with CDMA phones is that there is lots of stuff that has to be updated (**firmware**). Baseband updates, radio firmware updates.

Preferred Roaming List (PRL): if messages come in slow, browsing is slower, etc. We may want to update the PRL.

### Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)

Come with a SIM card

### Other Important Numbers

**International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)** - built into the SIM itself

**International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)** - defines the phone itself.

**VPNs**

- Give it a name

* Set up a VPN

- Know the server IP address

# Mobile Devices and Email

E-mail setup on smartphones always means adding an e-mail account

Traditional e-mails require SMTP and an IMAP/POP server address and account passwords

Most traditional e-mail servers use encrypted port numbers

To set up email, we need to know the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of our SMTP server.

Username and password to sign onto that SMTP server

Port number for SMTP (usually port 25)

FQDN for the IMAP server

Username and password

Port Number for IMAP

### Encrypted Versions

**SMTP**: Port 465 or 587
**IMAP**: Port 993
**POP3**: Port 995

With these ports, we are getting Point-to-Point Encryption(P2PE)

### Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)

Whenever we attach a file to an email, we are using something called a MIME. MIME takes a binary file, and takes every 8 bits and turns it into an ASCII code.

S/MIME encrypts the content
