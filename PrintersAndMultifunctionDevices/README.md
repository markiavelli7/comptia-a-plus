# Printers and Multifunction Devices

## Laser Printers

1. Processing - print job comes in and is stored on local memory
2. Charging - primary corona puts a really strong negative charge on it
3. Exposing - the laser writes on the photo-sensitve drum and reduces the charge wherever the laser hits it
4. Developing - the toner comes out of the toner hopper and hits onto the photo-sensitive drum
5. Transferring - transfer corona charges the paper with a very strong positive charge, as the paper gets closer to the drum, toner goes straight to the drum
6. Fusing - heat and pressure press the toner directly into the paper
7. Cleaning - Rubber scraper scrapes off any residual toner

CMYK toner is for color

## Inkjet Printers

Inkjet printers use heat or mechanical process to push ink through the print heads to the paper

Multifunction devices (MFDs) include printers, scanners, copiers, and fax machines

Inkjet maintenance means running cleaning routines for the nozzles, plus some form of calibration

## Impact Printers

Impact printers strike an ink ribbon to write on paper

Very useful for printing on multipart forms

Maintenance includes replacing the ribbon and keeping it clean

## Thermal Printers

Heat special paper to create a printout

Thermal printers can print to multipart (thermal forms)

Maintenance includes frequent paper changes and keeping the heating element clean

## Installing a Local Printer

Connection Methods

- USB

* Serial connection

**Firmware updates**: very common for printers, also something that a lot of people forget to do

**Spooler** - associated software that stores the print jobs. The spooler queues the print jobs and sends them to the printer in the correct order.

## Sharing Printers

Sharing a local printer over a network requires sharing enabled and a share name

Security options enable local control over the print spooler

To connect to a shared printer, add a printer, but select the shared printer rather than the local printer.

## Installing Wireless and Cloud Printers

A wired network printer has an Ethernet NIC and plugs directly into the network

A wireless printer requires configuration to get on an 802.11 network

Wireless print utilities can help troubleshoot any connectivity problems

Cloud printing enables mobile devices to print to a printer associated with an online account, such as a Google account

## Troubleshooting Printers

**Unable to Install Printer** - lacking administrative rights to install the printer. Or there is no printer to install. Someone hasn't shared the printer or it is a network printer that isn't even on the network.

**No Connectivity** - are we physically connected to it, if it is a network printer, do we have good DHCP. Are other people able to connect to it? A lot of the time, this is a generic network problem and has nothing to do with the printer itself.

**Access Denied** - administrative issue, you have to have permission to print to shared printers

**No Image on Printer Display** - Power? Is the printer in some form of sleep mode?

**Paper not Feeding** - Pickup roller problems

**Low Memory** - Common on laser printers. Reduce resolutions or buy more RAM.

**Error Codes** - Research error codes

**Garbled Characters** - Corrupted software or bad drivers.

**Vertical Lines on Page** - Foreign matter on our optically sensitive roller. Throw the toner cartridge in the garbage and get a new one.

**Color Prints in the Wrong Print Color** - Driver, or we've lost one of our colors.

**Streaks** - Clogged ink jets. Go into maintenance mode to clean the nozzles

**Faded Prints** - If laser, we could be low on toner. Give it a shake and put in a new toner.

**Ghost Images** - Rubber cleaning piece has broken, replace the toner.

**Toner Not Fusing to Paper** - Something wrong with the fuser assembly. Replace the fuser assembly

**Creased Paper** - Pickup roller trouble, put in a maintenance kit

Mentally re-install the printer to check for possible issues
