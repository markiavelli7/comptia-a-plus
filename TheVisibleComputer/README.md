# What is an Operating System

An operating system controls all the programs on a computer

The core of an operating system is the kernel

Running programs are called processes

Operating systems use device drivers to talk to hardware

## Kernel

Built into every operating system is a core part called the kernel which handles primary memory management. If someone wants to start a program, the kernel decides where that program will sit in RAM, how often it will run, etc.

When we run a program, it goes from the hard drive onto system memory (RAM).

A kernel acts as a conductor and helps keep all of the processes running in an efficient and effective manner.

Built into every CPU, there is the ability to address memory.

An operating system knows exactly how to talk to particular type of CPU.

## Hardware

Every operating system has to have device drivers for any given piece of hardware.

**Device Manager** shows us all of the drivers we have installed.

# Users and Super Users

All operating systems have user accounts with encrypted passwords

All operating systems have super user accounts that have complet access to everything

The Windows super user is called Administrator

The Linux and macOS super user is called Root

# Why Windows

Microsoft invented the concept of per-processor agreements

Every Windows system has its own local usernames and passwords

Windows Active Directory domains store domain usernames and passwords

Single sign-on enables users to log in using their domain accounts anywhere on the network

Both OS X and Linux use Windows networking for Single Sign-On (SSO)
